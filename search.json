Quarto constitutes a method of cohesively editing code and text within a single document, a practice termed literate programming. It enables you to compose code, generate output, conduct analyses in the same document, format the content, and subsequently export it to diverse formats like Word documents, PDFs and html. Additionally, Quarto facilitates the creation of slides, dashboards, books, and websites.

    "text": "2.2 Objects\nWhen you run code in R, the results are shown in the console. However, you cannot directly reuse these results in further operations, which is what we want to do. To address this, we use objects. Objects in R act as containers that store values, allowing you to keep information for later use. To create an object in R, you use the assignment operator &lt;- .\n\nmy_object &lt;- 2\nmy_object\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nLet’s consider an example from the most recent French general election. The results led to a highly fragmented parliament, with 11 different parliamentary groups and no single party or coalition able to form an absolute majority on its own. This situation raises the question of which coalitions could be formed to achieve a majority and pass legislation. The code below uses objects to store the number of seats obtained by each parliamentary group.\n\n# Left-wing groups\ncommunists_seats &lt;- 17\nlfi_seats &lt;- 72\ngreens_seats &lt;- 38\nsocialists_seats &lt;- 66\n\n# Macron's party and allies\nrenaissance_seats &lt;- 99  # This is Macron's party\nmodem_seats &lt;- 36        # MODEM, a centrist party\nhorizon_seats &lt;- 31      # Horizon, party of the former PM Édouard Philippe\n\n# Right-wing groups\nconservatives_seats &lt;- 47  # \"Les Républicains\"\n\n# Far-right groups\nrn_seats &lt;- 126            # National Rally (RN)\nciotti_seats &lt;- 16         # Former conservatives who allied with Le Pen's party\n\n# Others\nliot_seats &lt;- 22           # A mix of some independent centrists and regionalists\nnone_seats &lt;- 7            # Non-affiliated MPs\n\nAfter executing these lines, you should be able to see the objects created and their values in the environment pane located in the upper-right section of RStudio. Once these objects created, it is possible to perform operations on them. For instance, it is possible to compute the total number of seats of actual existing coalitions by summing the number of seats of the different parties that compose them and saving them in new objects. Below, I create a new object left_seats that stores the total number of seats obtained by the left-wing parties by summing the different objects that store the number of seats obtained by the left-wing parties.\n\nleft_seats &lt;- communists_seats + lfi_seats + greens_seats + socialists_seats\nleft_seats\n\n[1] 193\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn !\n\n\n\nCreate two new objects macron_seats and far_right_seats that store the total number of seats obtained by Macron’s allies and far-right parties respectively.\n\nSolution.

    "text": "2.3 Vectors\nThe objects we used so far contained only one numeric value. However, what we mostly manipulate in R are vectors, which are sequences of different values on which we can perform operations. Vectors can be of different types (eg : numeric, character, logical, date) but they have to be of the same type. For instance, a numeric vector is a sequence of different numbers and a character vector is a sequence of different strings. Vectors are also unidimensionals which mean they contains only one sequence of values and not several such as matrices do.\nWe can generate vectors with c() which stands for “concatenate”. For instance, here, I create a vector containing the values of the seats obtained by different coalitions in the election. As a result, the vector coalition_seats contains the number of seats obtained by the left, Macron’s party and allies, the far-right and the conservatives.\n\ncoalition_seats &lt;- c(left_seats, macron_seats, far_right_seats, conservatives_seats)\ncoalition_seats\n\n[1] 193 166 142  47\n\n\nWe use vectors to store different values because it is possible to perform the same operation on all the values of a vector at once. Let’s say we want to know the number of seats that an existing coalition would need to have an absolute majority in the parliament. We can do this by creating a new object, majority, that stores the number of seats needed for an absolute majority, and then subtracting the number of seats obtained by the different coalitions from this value. The result will be a vector showing the number of seats each coalition needs to reach an absolute majority, which we could also store in a new object if desired.\n\nmajority &lt;- 577/2 + 0.5 # Half of the number of seats (577) + 0.5 to round up (there is no half MP)\n\nmajority \n\n[1] 289\n\nmajority - coalition_seats\n\n[1]  96 123 147 242\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Characters vectors\nSo far, we have only used numerical vectors, which consist of numbers. However, we can also create character vectors, which are made up of strings enclosed in quotes (either single ' or double \"). For example, we can create a vector containing the names of different parliamentary leaders.\n\nleft_leaders &lt;- c(\"Chassaigne\", \"Chatelain\", \"Panot\", \"Vallaud\") # Create a vector of left-wing leaders\nfar_right_leaders &lt;- c(\"Ciotti\", \"Le Pen\") # Create a vector of far-right leaders\n\nAs for other vectors, you can combine them in a single vector which will return a vector with all the leaders’ names.\n\nleaders &lt;- c(left_leaders, far_right_leaders)\nleaders\n\n[1] \"Chassaigne\" \"Chatelain\"  \"Panot\"      \"Vallaud\"    \"Ciotti\"    \n[6] \"Le Pen\"    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn !\n\n\n\nCreate a vector that contains the names of the leaders of the Macron’s party : Attal, Fesneau, Marcangeli. Then, add this vector to the leaders vector and store the result in a new object all_leaders.\n\nSolution.

Understanding and handling missing values is crucial because they can influence the results of your analysis or even cause some functions to return errors. For instance, imagine I haven’t found any information about the number of seats one parliamentary group get, but I want to retain this information in my vector.

To check if a vector contains NA values, you can use the is.na() function. This function will returns what is called a logical vector that is a sequence of values where each element is either (TRUE) or not (FALSE). Logical vectors are often used to represent conditions or logical statements.\n\nis.na(parl_seats) # Check which values of a vector are NAs\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[13]  TRUE\n\n\nThis is important because certain functions will not operate properly if there are NA values in your data.

    "text": "2.6 Packages and libraries\nThe functions we’ve discussed so far, such as sum() and mean(), come from base R. These are pre-loaded functions available immediately upon starting R. However, many functions you’ll encounter aren’t part of base R but instead belong to specific packages that individuals or groups have developed. You can think of packages as collections of functions crafted to simplify certain tasks or to introduce new capabilities to R. For example, there’s the tidyverse package, which I asked you to install before the class\nTo install a package in R, you can use the install.packages() function, passing the name of the package in quotation marks (either single or double). I recommend doing this installation in the console since you don’t need to save this step; it’s a one-time action. However, every time you start your script or Quarto document, you’ll need to load the package. To do this, use the library() function, providing the package name as an argument, but without the quotation marks.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ─────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0.9000 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors",

    "text": "2.7 Dataframes and tibbles\nWhen processing data, we primarily interact with vectors through the manipulation of dataframes in R. Dataframes are two-dimensional structures that contain rows and columns. Each column is a vector, and each row is an observation. Dataframes are the primary data structure used for data manipulation, computation, and visualization in R. In this class, we’ll work with a specific type of dataframe that comes from the tidyverse package called a tibble. Tibbles are a modern and enhanced version of dataframes that make them easier to print and manipulate.\nTo understand what dataframes look like, let us continue with the results of the french elections. I manually create a tibble with the tibble() function with different variables about parliamentary groups\n\nleft_coalition &lt;- tibble(\n  party = c(\"Communists\", \"Greens\", \"LFI\", \"Socialists\"),\n  leader = c(\"Chassaigne\", \"Chatelain\", \"Panot\", \"Vallaud\"),\n  seats_2024 = c(17, 38, 72, 66),\n  seats_2022 = c(22, 21, 75, 31)\n)\n\nleft_coalition\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n  party      leader     seats_2024 seats_2022\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Communists Chassaigne         17         22\n2 Greens     Chatelain          38         21\n3 LFI        Panot              72         75\n4 Socialists Vallaud            66         31\n\n\nYou see now that we have a new object in our Environment Pane with 4 observations and 4 variables.\nDifferent functions are available to get an idea of the informations and shape of the dataframe, which are useful when we load an unknown dataset and we want to understand its structure, what are the observations and variables.\n\nglimpse(left_coalition) # Get a glimpse of your data\n\nRows: 4\nColumns: 4\n$ party      &lt;chr&gt; \"Communists\", \"Greens\", \"LFI\", \"Socialists\"\n$ leader     &lt;chr&gt; \"Chassaigne\", \"Chatelain\", \"Panot\", \"Vallaud\"\n$ seats_2024 &lt;dbl&gt; 17, 38, 72, 66\n$ seats_2022 &lt;dbl&gt; 22, 21, 75, 31\n\ncolnames(left_coalition) # Retrieve column names of the dataframe\n\n[1] \"party\"      \"leader\"     \"seats_2024\" \"seats_2022\"\n\nsummary(left_coalition) # Return a summary of the variables\n\n    party              leader            seats_2024      seats_2022   \n Length:4           Length:4           Min.   :17.00   Min.   :21.00  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:32.75   1st Qu.:21.75  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :52.00   Median :26.50  \n                                       Mean   :48.25   Mean   :37.25  \n                                       3rd Qu.:67.50   3rd Qu.:42.00  \n                                       Max.   :72.00   Max.   :75.00  \n\n\nIf we want to access only one variable (one vector) of that dataframe, we use the $ sign.

    "section": "\n2.8 Import and write data",
    "text": "2.8 Import and write data\nUp until now, we have been creating data manually for demonstration purposes. As we move forward, we will focus on analyzing real data. Every data analysis project starts with acquiring data. You can generate your own data through surveys, web scraping, or manual data coding (primary data sources). However, there are also many pre-existing datasets available for use (secondary data sources). These datasets are often provided by researchers, governments, NGOs, companies, international organizations, and more. I highly recommend checking out this list of political datasets curated by Erik Gahner Larsen. Throughout this course, we will use some of these established datasets in political science.\n\n2.8.1 File formats, paths and R projects\nTo analyze data in R, we first need to import it. While this might sound simple, it can be challenging for beginners. To read a file in R, we need to know two important things: the file format and the path.\nData comes in various file formats, which are standardized ways of storing and organizing data in digital files. These formats dictate how information is encoded and structured, allowing different software programs to understand and interpret the data correctly. The most common format for data is .csv (comma-separated values). In political science, you will also encounter Stata (.dta) and SPSS (.sav) files. R uses different functions to read files depending on their format.\nSecondly, R needs to know where the data is located on your system. A “path” shows the position of a file or folder within your file system, detailing the series of directories and subdirectories leading to the file. There are two types of paths:\n\nThe absolute path gives the complete location of a file or directory, beginning at the root of the file system. Examples include: /home/user/documents/myfile.txt for Unix-like systems, and C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\myfile.txt for Windows.\nA relative path indicates the location of a file or directory in relation to the current working directory. For instance, data/mydata.csv points to a file named mydata.csv in the data subdirectory of the present directory.\n\nThe working directory refers to the directory where R is currently operating. If you access files in R without providing an absolute path, it defaults to searching within this working directory.\nYou can see your current working directory in R using the getwd() function. To set a new working directory, use the setwd() function, specifying the desired path as its argument.\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/malo/Documents/teaching/2024_intro_r/session01\"\n\n\nPlease note that using absolute paths in your code is considered a bad practice because it can make your code less usable for others. Instead, I recommend using R projects. An R project is a dedicated workspace for your R work, where you keep all your files, data, scripts, and output documents together. When you open an R project, it sets everything up so that your files are easy to find and your work is easier to share and reproduce.\nFrom the top left corner of RStudio, click on File and then select New Project. You’ll then be given three options: to create a project in an existing directory, to create one in a new directory, or to check out a project from a version control repository like Git.\nIf you choose an existing directory, navigate to that directory. If you opt for a new directory, you’ll need to name your project and decide its save location on your computer. Once you finalize your choice by clicking Create Project, the working directory in RStudio will automatically be set to your project location. This means that any scripts, data files, or outputs you work on will be saved here by default, making them easier to find and reference later.\nInside your project directory, you’ll notice a file with an .Rproj extension, such as MyProject.Rproj. In the future, you can open this file to launch RStudio directly into this project, ensuring the working directory is already set. It’s also advisable to set up specific folders within your project directory for different components like scripts, data, and figures. This keeps everything tidy and organized as your project expands.\n\n2.8.2 Functions to import data in R\nThere are different functions to import data into R.\n\nFor CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, the base R function read.csv() is commonly used. However, within the tidyverse package suite, the readr package provides the read_csv() function, which tends to be faster and more versatile. The read_csv2() function is designed for CSV files using semicolons ; as field separators and commas , as decimal points, compared to read_csv()which assumes commas as field separators.\nExcel files can be read using the readxl package, which provides the read_excel() function. This function can read both .xls and .xlsx files.\nFor SPSS data files, you can use the haven package. This package contains the function read_sav() for .sav files.\nStata data files, or .dta files, can also be read using the haven package with the read_dta() function.\n\nAll these functions enable you to read a file by specifying its path. Here, for example, I import a CSV file containing data on candidates for the 2024 legislative elections in France.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nfrench_candidates &lt;- read_csv(\"data/2024_french_candidates.csv\")\n\nRows: 4009 Columns: 9\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (7): code_department, departement, first_name, name, nuance, gender, pro...\ndbl (2): exprimes_per, age\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nglimpse(french_candidates)\n\nRows: 4,009\nColumns: 9\n$ code_department &lt;chr&gt; \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", …\n$ departement     &lt;chr&gt; \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\"…\n$ first_name      &lt;chr&gt; \"Christophe\", \"Xavier\", \"Sébastien\", \"Vincent\", \"Éric\"…\n$ name            &lt;chr&gt; \"MAÎTRE\", \"BRETON\", \"GUERAUD\", \"GUILLERMIN\", \"LAHY\", \"…\n$ nuance          &lt;chr&gt; \"RN\", \"LR\", \"UG\", \"ENS\", \"EXG\", \"DSV\", \"DSV\", \"RN\", \"D…\n$ exprimes_per    &lt;dbl&gt; 39.37, 23.96, 23.45, 11.68, 0.69, 0.52, 0.33, 39.20, 2…\n$ gender          &lt;chr&gt; \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", …\n$ age             &lt;dbl&gt; 55, 62, 51, 48, 58, 36, 42, 35, 44, 37, 49, 69, 59, 43…\n$ profession      &lt;chr&gt; \"(22) - Commerçant et assimilé\", \"(33) - Cadre de la f…\n\n\n\n2.8.3 Export data\nTypically, we might want to save data to our disk after adding information, merging different datasets, and so on. This is useful for later reuse or to share the data with someone else. To achieve this, simply replace ‘read’ with ‘write’ in all the functions I’ve introduced previously. You’ll also need to specify the name of the R object containing your data and the path where you wish to export the data.\n\nwrite_csv(french_candidates, \"data/french_candidates2.csv\")",

    "text": "2.9 Going further\n\n2.9.1 Naming things\nNote that I have written the names of objects with underscores. There are different conventions to write object names in R that you can discover here. I personnaly use snake case which use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words.\n\n2.9.2 Packages\nRather than importing packages with library(), it is also possible to use the :: operator such as :\n\ndplyr::glimpse(french_candidates)\n\nRows: 4,009\nColumns: 9\n$ code_department &lt;chr&gt; \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", …\n$ departement     &lt;chr&gt; \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\", \"Ain\"…\n$ first_name      &lt;chr&gt; \"Christophe\", \"Xavier\", \"Sébastien\", \"Vincent\", \"Éric\"…\n$ name            &lt;chr&gt; \"MAÎTRE\", \"BRETON\", \"GUERAUD\", \"GUILLERMIN\", \"LAHY\", \"…\n$ nuance          &lt;chr&gt; \"RN\", \"LR\", \"UG\", \"ENS\", \"EXG\", \"DSV\", \"DSV\", \"RN\", \"D…\n$ exprimes_per    &lt;dbl&gt; 39.37, 23.96, 23.45, 11.68, 0.69, 0.52, 0.33, 39.20, 2…\n$ gender          &lt;chr&gt; \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", \"M.\", …\n$ age             &lt;dbl&gt; 55, 62, 51, 48, 58, 36, 42, 35, 44, 37, 49, 69, 59, 43…\n$ profession      &lt;chr&gt; \"(22) - Commerçant et assimilé\", \"(33) - Cadre de la f…\n\n\nIt lets you reference a specific function from a package without loading the whole package. This is handy when two packages have functions with the same name, ensuring clarity in your code. It’s also useful for one-off function uses, avoiding the need to load an entire package. This approach can make code clearer and sometimes faster by reducing loaded dependencies\n\n2.9.3 Indexing\nWhen we manipulate vectors, we often want to access specific elements of them, which we call indexing, which is performed by using square brackets []. You can index either by position or by name.\nWhen I write leaders[3], I want the value of the third element of the leaders vector, this is indexing by position. But when I write leaders[leaders == \"Le Pen\"], I index by name because I want the elements that have Le Pen as value.\n\nleaders\n\n[1] \"Chassaigne\" \"Chatelain\"  \"Panot\"      \"Vallaud\"    \"Ciotti\"    \n[6] \"Le Pen\"    \n\nleaders[4] # Get the third element of the vector\n\n[1] \"Vallaud\"\n\nleaders[-3] # Get everything but the third element of the vector\n\n[1] \"Chassaigne\" \"Chatelain\"  \"Vallaud\"    \"Ciotti\"     \"Le Pen\"    \n\nleaders[c(1,4)] # Get the first and the fifth elements of the vector\n\n[1] \"Chassaigne\" \"Vallaud\"   \n\nleaders[1:3] # Get elements from the first to the third\n\n[1] \"Chassaigne\" \"Chatelain\"  \"Panot\"     \n\nleaders[leaders == \"Le Pen\"] # Which has Le Pen as value\n\n[1] \"Le Pen\"\n\nleaders[leaders != \"Le Pen\"] # Which has not Le Pen as value\n\n[1] \"Chassaigne\" \"Chatelain\"  \"Panot\"      \"Vallaud\"    \"Ciotti\"    \n\nleaders[leaders %in% c(\"Le Pen\", \"Ciotti\")]# Which has Le Pen or Ciotti\n\n[1] \"Ciotti\" \"Le Pen\"\n\nleaders[!leaders %in% c(\"Le Pen\", \"Ciotti\")]# Which has neither Le Pen nor Ciotti\n\n[1] \"Chassaigne\" \"Chatelain\"  \"Panot\"      \"Vallaud\"   \n\n\n\n2.9.4 Logical vectors\nAnother type of vector in R is the logical vector, which consists of Boolean values: TRUE or FALSE. Logical vectors are useful for evaluating conditions. They can be used to check for errors in data or to filter variables based on specific criteria.\n\nc(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nFor instance, we could check whether there are no mistakes and confirm that Le Pen is not a leader of the left coalition. This means verifying that no value in the left_leaders vector is equal to “Le Pen”.\n\nleft_leaders == \"Le Pen\"\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\nfar_right_leaders == \"Le Pen\"\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nThe evaluation of conditions can also be used to compare numeric values. For instance, we can check whether the left coalition has more seats than the far-right coalition.\n\nleft_seats &gt; far_right_seats\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n2.9.5 More on vectors and functions\nIn R, functions often expect inputs of specific types. If you pass a character vector containing numeric numbers as strings to a function that expects a numeric vector, it may not behave as expected. As shown below, the function returns a NA which means Not available/applicable. When R encounters something it doesn’t understand, it returns an error message with indications about the problem.\n\nparl_seats_chr &lt;- c(\"17\", \"38\", \"66\", \"72\", \"99\", \"36\", \"31\", \"47\", \"16\", \"126\", \"7\", \"22\")\nparl_seats_chr\n\n [1] \"17\"  \"38\"  \"66\"  \"72\"  \"99\"  \"36\"  \"31\"  \"47\"  \"16\"  \"126\" \"7\"   \"22\" \n\nmean(parl_seats_chr) # This returns NA\n\nWarning in mean.default(parl_seats_chr): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nSimilarly, computing the sum of the parl_seats_chr vector will work as expected but trying to calculate the sum of our leaders character vector composed of leaders’s names will not give a meaningful result.\n\nsum(parl_seats_chr)\n\nError in sum(parl_seats_chr): invalid 'type' (character) of argument\n\nsum(leaders) # This is an error\n\nError in sum(leaders): invalid 'type' (character) of argument\n\n\nIf you are not sure about the type of your vectors, you can check with the class() function that will give you the answer.\n\nclass(parl_seats)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(parl_seats_chr)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nSometimes, a vector has not the good type for the operation we want to perform. To check the type of a vector, you can use the family of is. functions such as is.numeric() and is.character() that return a boolean operator. In case the vector is not the right type for our purpose, wan can try to coerce them with the family of as. functions such as as.numeric() and as.character().\n\nis.numeric(parl_seats_chr) # Check if numeric\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nparl_seats_num &lt;- as.numeric(parl_seats_chr) # Coerce to numeric\nis.numeric(parl_seats_num) # Check again if numeric\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nmean(parl_seats_num) # Compute the mean\n\n[1] 48.08333\n\n\nFunctions that you will find in R have been created by someone. You can also create your own functions in R. You usually start doing it when you are more advanced so do not worry it you find it hard, it is just for you to know that it is possible. Here I just create a simplified other function to calculate a mean in R.\n\n# Create a function to compute the mean of a vector\n\ncompute_mean &lt;- function(x) {\n  # Compute the sum of the values in the vector and divide by the number of values (length)\n  mean &lt;- sum(x)/length(x)\n  \n  # Return the result\n  return(mean)\n}\n\ncompute_mean(parl_seats)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\n2.9.5.1 More on the tidyverse\nThe tidyverse isn’t just a single package but rather a meta-package, meaning it bundles together several other packages, each with its own set of functions. For example, one of these bundled packages is stringr, which offers tools for manipulating character vectors. Since stringr is part of the tidyverse, if you’ve already loaded the tidyverse, there’s no need to load stringr separately. With it, you can perform tasks like converting strings in a vector to uppercase or lowercase.\n\nleaders\n\n[1] \"Chassaigne\" \"Chatelain\"  \"Panot\"      \"Vallaud\"    \"Ciotti\"    \n[6] \"Le Pen\"    \n\nstr_to_lower(leaders) # Change strings to lower class\n\n[1] \"chassaigne\" \"chatelain\"  \"panot\"      \"vallaud\"    \"ciotti\"    \n[6] \"le pen\"    \n\nstr_to_upper(leaders) # Change strings to upper class\n\n[1] \"CHASSAIGNE\" \"CHATELAIN\"  \"PANOT\"      \"VALLAUD\"    \"CIOTTI\"    \n[6] \"LE PEN\"    \n\nstr_detect(leaders, \"C\") # Detect if strings that contains a \"C\"\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nWe can also combine characters vectors together with str_c().\n\nparties &lt;- c(\"Communists\", \"Greens\", \"LFI\", \"Socialists\", \"Ciotti's party\", \"National Rally\")\n\nstr_c(leaders, \" is the parliamentary leader of \", parties)\n\n[1] \"Chassaigne is the parliamentary leader of Communists\"\n[2] \"Chatelain is the parliamentary leader of Greens\"     \n[3] \"Panot is the parliamentary leader of LFI\"            \n[4] \"Vallaud is the parliamentary leader of Socialists\"   \n[5] \"Ciotti is the parliamentary leader of Ciotti's party\"\n[6] \"Le Pen is the parliamentary leader of National Rally\"",

If R gives you an error you don’t understand, it’s likely that someone else has encountered the same issue and discussed it online. Start by checking if others have asked similar questions. Websites dedicated to R programming frequently have solutions from experienced users. Additionally, Google can be a valuable resource. Whether you’re trying to accomplish a task (e.g., “how to import a .dta file in R”) or resolve an error, searching the error message or your query can provide valuable insights.\nOften, you’ll find yourself on a site called Stackoverflow, a community hub for users of various programming languages. You can often copy and paste the code you find there, but it’s important to tweak and adapt it to fit your specific needs. Remember, in the world of programming, it’s common for everyone to borrow and adapt code from others. Another helpful resource is the Rstudio Commmunity. Additionally, the #rstats hashtag on Twitter can provide insights and discussions from the R programming community.",

By supplying ChatGPT with your errors or seeking guidance for specific coding tasks, you can obtain outstanding results. I strongly suggest incorporating it into your coding journey. However, exercise caution: ChatGPT might sometimes suggest non-existent functions or present inaccurate information. It isn’t a magic bullet, but you can quickly assess the accuracy of its suggestions by testing the code in R. If the code doesn’t work correctly, the information may be incorrect. For instance, check out this example example where I asked ChatGPT to explain how to import a Stata file in R.",

    "text": "3.5 Most common errors\nFinally, some errors are really common and you will probably face them often. I provide you here a (non exhaustive) list of those to help you troubleshooting1.\n\n3.5.0.1 Syntax errors\nMany errors beginners encounter in R stem from syntax issues: a slight coding mistake can lead RStudio to misunderstand your intentions. Common errors include typos in function names or forgetting symbols like ), ,, or \". For example, if you missed a closing \" when trying to subset the Le Pen string from the leaders vector: leaders[leaders == \"Le Pen], you’d likely see a + in the console. This indicates that R is awaiting further input to process your command.\n\n3.5.0.2 The “not found” errors\n\n\nError: function 'x' not found : mispelling or package not loaded\n\n\nLibrary(tidyverse)\n\nError in Library(tidyverse): could not find function \"Library\"\n\nmeans(c(15,16,19)) \n\nError in means(c(15, 16, 19)): could not find function \"means\"\n\nread_html(\"https://labour.org.uk/category/latest/press-release/\") # Read html code from a webpage\n\nError in read_html(\"https://labour.org.uk/category/latest/press-release/\"): could not find function \"read_html\"\n\n\nMistakes related to capitalization or misspelling are common. For instance, attempting to compute the mean of a number vector but mistakenly adding an “s” to the mean() function will lead to an error. In another scenario, you might aim to read a webpage’s HTML code for web scraping purposes. While the function might be correctly spelled, the error arises if the required rvest package isn’t loaded beforehand. When encountering such errors, ensure you’ve spelled functions correctly and loaded the necessary package (e.g., using library(rvest)).\n\n\nError: object 'x' not found : typo, forgot to run the line or saving object\n\n\nleaders &lt;- c(\"Chassaigne\", \"Vallaud\", \"Chatelain\", \"Panot\")\nleader[1]\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'leader' not found\n\n\nYou might alo want to look only at leaders from right-wing parties in the object right_wing_leaders Here, the error happens because we did not save any object with this value yet.\n\nright_wing_leaders\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'right_wing_leaders' not found\n\nright_wing_leaders &lt;- c(\"Waucquiez\")\nright_wing_leaders\n\n[1] \"Waucquiez\"\n\n\nError in install.packages : object 'x' not found\n\ninstall.packages(rvest)\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'rvest' not found\n\n\nMost of the time, you just forget the \"\" and you should write install.packages(\"rvest\"). It might also be a typo in the package name (eg. you would have an error with install.packag(\"Rvest\").\n\nError: 'x' does not exist in current working directory\n\n\nreadr::read_csv(\"thisdata.csv\")\n\nError: 'thisdata.csv' does not exist in current working directory ('/Users/malo/Documents/teaching/2024_intro_r/session01').\n\n\nThis error typically arises when you’ve given an incorrect path, and R can’t find your file. Use getwd() to check your current working directory and then adjust the file path as needed.\n\n3.5.0.3 Inconsistent data types\nWe have seen already that R comes with different data types such as logical or character. Many functions takes as argument a vector of a specific type and will not work on other. Below an obvious example : if we try to compute the mean of a character vector, this will not work.\n\nleaders\n\n[1] \"Chassaigne\" \"Vallaud\"    \"Chatelain\"  \"Panot\"     \n\nclass(leaders)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nmean(leaders)\n\nWarning in mean.default(leaders): argument is not numeric or logical: returning\nNA\n\n\n[1] NA",

The dplyr::count() function is used for this purpose.\nIn Exercise 1, we observed that the qog dataset has a country-year structure. For each country, there is a series of indicators, with one value per year. The dataset includes a year variable and a cname variable representing the country.\nWe might want to know how many country observations we have for each year. To do this, we can use count() with the year variable, that will give us the number of observations for each year. If we look at the results, we see that the dataset has observations from 1946 to 2020 with an increasing number of countries in the dataset over time.\n\ncount(qog, year)\n\n# A tibble: 75 × 2\n    year     n\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1  1946    75\n 2  1947    76\n 3  1948    82\n 4  1949    85\n 5  1950    88\n 6  1951    88\n 7  1952    89\n 8  1953    89\n 9  1954    91\n10  1955    94\n# ℹ 65 more rows\n\ntable(qog$year) # Alternative way to do it\n\n\n1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 \n  75   76   82   85   88   88   89   89   91   94   96   97   97   98  103  118 \n1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 \n 119  125  127  131  135  138  141  143  144  146  149  149  151  154  160  160 \n1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 \n 160  165  166  167  168  168  170  170  170  172  172  172  172  173  189  192 \n1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 \n 192  193  193  193  193  193  193  193  194  194  194  194  195  195  195  195 \n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 \n 195  195  195  195  195  194  194  194  194  194  194 \n\n\nIf we want to cross the year and cname variables, we can use the count() function with both variables.
